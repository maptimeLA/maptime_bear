###Make a maptime bear
----
With this repo, you will be able to make your own bear and have it pose for your maptimey enjoyment.<br>
Here are some very brief but soon to be detailed instructions<br><br>
1. Get <a href="http://www.sketchup.com/">Sketchup</a>, its free!<br>
2. The working model is in the "sketchup_model" folder of this repo.<br>
    There are two working models, the bear by the tree or the standing bear<br>
3. Select the standing bear as this will have posable joints for you to easily position its limbs
